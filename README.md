This software, named **COSMOS** (Computation of Sensitivities in Model ODE Systems), is the computer program developed for calculating sensitivity values at a steady state in metabolic reaction networks with nonlinear flux equations. 

The highly-accurate (i.e., highly-reliable) calculation is executed by a combination of the systematic calculation algorithm in Biochemical Systems Theory and the complex-step differentiation, providing sensitivity values in the range of round-off errors.

The metabolite concentrations at a steady state are successfully determined from a simple set of their initial values. 

The detailed information is available in the paper: (F. Shiraishi, E. Yoshida, and E. O. Voit, “An efficient and very accurate method for calculating steady-state sensitivities in metabolic reaction systems”).
